      title: 'Express Newark Website',
      body: 'Level NYC was commissioned to design and develop a website that strengthens collaboration and engagement across the Newark and Rutgers University communities. The site clearly communicates the organization’s mission while supporting its role as a hub for creativity, education, and community impact. Working closely with Express Newark leadership, program directors, and community stakeholders, we brought expressnewark.org to life through a thoughtful, user-focused digital experience.'
    },
    body2: 'Over the course of a year, we collaborated closely with Express Newark leadership and program directors to design and launch expressnewark.org. The website’s design and user experience reflect Express Newark’s ecosystem—an inclusive “third space” where partnerships, contributors, and disciplines intersect through collaboration and public creative practice. The site functions as a dynamic platform for eleven partnerships and over eighty contributors, each with dedicated pages to share stories, events, exhibits, and media. A color-coded system extends the brand’s “third space” concept, visually uniting content while allowing diverse voices to coexist within a shared, living digital ecosystem.',
    body3: 'Express Newark partnerships can publish exhibit posts that appear across the site, including the exhibit archive, homepage, and individual partnership pages. Each exhibit post supports rich content—such as key details, imagery, galleries, block quotes, and downloadable press materials—allowing partners to fully showcase their work.',
    body4: 'Similar to exhibits, partnerships can publish event posts that appear on the event archive, homepage, and respective partnership pages. Each event post includes essential details—such as date, time, and location—along with imagery, RSVP links, and ticketing information when applicable.',
